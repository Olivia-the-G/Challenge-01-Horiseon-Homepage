# Challenge 01 Horiseon Homepage

## Description

Using the starter code for the webpage, I edited the html and css files to use semantic elements. I did this in order to make the website more accessible for persons using screen readers to assist them in using their computers. I was able to refine my knowledge and understanding of semantics and practice properly organizing my css files.
